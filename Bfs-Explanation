Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
Problem Solved by the Algorithm
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for exploring and traversing graphs and trees. It is particularly helpful in finding the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in unweighted graphs and has various applications in networking, social networks, and more.

Design/Approach of the Algorithm
The BFS algorithm systematically explores a graph or tree level by level, starting from the source node. It ensures that all nodes at the current level are visited before moving on to the nodes at the next level. This approach makes it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

Detailed Description of the Algorithm
The BFS algorithm can be described in pseudo-code as follows:

Create a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be visited.
Initialize an empty set or array to keep track of visited nodes.
Enqueue the source node into the queue.
While the queue is not empty:
a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
b. If the node has not been visited:
i. Mark the node as visited.
ii. Process the node as needed.
iii. Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the node.
Analysis
Time Complexity: The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(V) for the visited set and O(V) for the queue, resulting in a total space complexity of O(V).
Walkthrough of How the Algorithm Processes Example Inputs
Let's illustrate how BFS works with a simple example. Consider the following graph:

Copy code
    A -- B
    |    |
    C -- D
Suppose we start BFS at node A:

Initialize the queue: Queue = [A], Visited = []
Dequeue A, mark it as visited, and enqueue its neighbors: Queue = [B, C], Visited = [A]
Dequeue B, mark it as visited, and enqueue its neighbors (none in this case): Queue = [C], Visited = [A, B]
Dequeue C, mark it as visited, and enqueue its neighbors: Queue = [D], Visited = [A, B, C]
Dequeue D, mark it as visited, and enqueue its neighbors (none in this case): Queue = [], Visited = [A, B, C, D]
The order of traversal is A -> B -> C -> D, which is the breadth-first order.
